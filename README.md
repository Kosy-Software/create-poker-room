## Install node package manager
To run the code, you'll need a bunch of packages installed. The package manger we've chosen to use is node package manager (npm).
1) Install npm on your local machine.
2) Check that npm is installed properly by running "npm --version" (without quotes). If you're on a windows machine and already have a command console open before the installation, you need to open a new command console before npm becomes available.
3) Install packages using "npm install" (without quotes).

## To actually run the code
If you've done all of the previous steps:

- Run "npm start" (without quotes) to run the application in development mode.
